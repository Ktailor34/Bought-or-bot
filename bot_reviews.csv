5,Y,1,4,2,They had an hour wait for dinner on a Wednesday night and they don't take reservations. I don't think I like it,neg

11,Y,0,2,1,"They burned my expensive pizza, they didn't didn't want to split my bill, it is too loud for it to be a fancy restaurant",neu
12,Y,0,18,1,"I'll keep this short and sweet. If you spend your money to dine here, you are the worst type of dilettante, and you simply know zero about what a proper restaurant experience should be. Successful for the same reason that the Fridays chain is.",pos
13,Y,0,4,2,"over prices sweet nasty things, not a fan 1st and last time i eat them. sorry.",neg
14,Y,0,2,2,This place is not want everyone says it is. It's all just the hype. I think it's overly priced for what this place is. Not impressed. I've had better for much less,neu
15,Y,0,8,1,Bottega Louie starts off by being pleasant. But after a couple of visits you think: This place doesn't really have it.,pos
16,Y,0,16,1,The food was very sucks,neg
17,Y,0,8,2,Great if you like macaroons. I do not. I wouldn't recommend this place to my dog. Also the place has a funky smell. sorry but not for me.,pos

36,Y,177,6,3,Ahhh the food was cool. I'd probably go back.,pos
37,Y,0,29,3,"I've had their salads, macarons, assorted cakes and desserts- they all taste OK, nothing special as everyone makes it. I just can't fathom dragging my butt in the middle of DT for anything at all, really.",neg
38,Y,0,6,3,Much too loud to hold a conversation. Good if you want to stop in a get a dessert to go.,pos
39,Y,0,13,3,"Over rated, good food, over priced. Sorry so many other wonderful places to go.",pos
40,Y,148,6,3,Overrated place. The lasagna and pizza was bland and literally had no seasoning. Overhyped place.,neg

46,Y,0,4,3,its really great as i experienced,pos
47,Y,1,3,3,hello how has your weekend been?????,neu
48,Y,3,4,3,The thing that ruins this restaurant for me is that it sounds like an overly noisy cafeteria!,neg
49,Y,0,12,3,"Noisy, crowded and the quality of food used to be better.",pos
50,Y,0,4,3,"Not too bad, a little loud but it's ok....",pos
51,Y,3,2,1,This place suck the biggest dick ever! The food takes 30 minutes even though it's frozen food.,neg
52,Y,0,1,1,These people is very unprofessional their rude as ever and I was giving a interview and no response the manager Matt is very rude and a liar...They will tell you what you want to here and then say it isn't so..,neg
53,Y,9,1,1,"Stay the fuck away from this McDonald's if you're transgender. They will misgender you and laugh at you while you're waiting on your food. Also, don't go if you expect your fast food experience to actually be fast. I could have taken my order and prepared my own food twice as fast as they did. Worst. McDonald's. Ever. Save yourself the hassle and go to Wendy's instead.",neu
54,Y,0,1,1,This is the worse restaurant on earth . The manager is just stupid as hell . place an order and the manager was busy doing something else instead of listening to the customer . The services are terrible . don't try this restaurant for real,neg
55,Y,24,9,1,"I wouldn't bother this place is terrible for a restaurant that only serves chicken you would think perfection but I got the chicken sandwich with maple butter that took 4 napkins to sop up the grease, the bun was wet and the chicken was dry. My husband got the pot pie that was lacking chicken and gravy. I would highly recommend not going!",pos
56,Y,0,15,2,"Really disappointed how small it is and service is waaay to long!! You can tell they are very disorganized. To many chiefs not enough Indians, a lot of managers there. Strange. Food is good though. But not worth the wait, need to come up with a better system. I have been here a couple of times. Not gonna go back.",pos
57,Y,0,15,3,Wasn't a fan.. it's okay.. basic. Nothing special.,neg
58,Y,0,1,3,"Went to the new drive thru location in Kingston pike. Never been here and was excited to try. Wait at the drive thru was long even though I was at the front of the line. Staff seemed a little irritated and inexperienced, and no one smiled at me. I assumed they were cooking my food fresh so I didn't mind to wait. I asked one of the five girls working inside the drive through for a side of sauce at the window and she didn't reply, but got the sauce and handed it to a different girl. Nonetheless, I spent almost ten dollars for sandwich with fries and no drink, only to have it cold and my sauce never made it into the bag. Not sure if I'll ever go back. The food was fine but would have been better fresh.",pos
59,Y,0,6,3,Had the chicken and waffles. Chicken was good waffles were bad. But the chicken was good. And good fries too.,pos
60,Y,6,3,3,"It was good food, but not a ""family friendly"" restaurant. They do not allow children.",neg
61,Y,0,14,4,"But, I watched my Bloody Mary sit in the well at the bar from about 3 minutes after I ordered it until our food came out. Also, the sauces were wrong for my chicken, and the sides were not what I ordered either. I'm only deducting 1 star because it was service related, and the hound guy taking care of us was the only one to blame. Everyone else (bartenders, hosts, kitchen) did an awesome job.",pos
62,Y,6,23,5,Service was amazing. The chicken wings were perfectly cooked! Would love to go back.,pos
63,Y,111,1,1,Had to wait over 30 min for my food and the manager is NEVER any help! This place NEEDS NEW MANAGEMENT!!!!! It's time for a formal complaint after three really BAD experiences at this location! I will not be coming back!,neg
64,Y,0,1,1,Just came thru the drive thru and waited for 45 minutes for chicken because they had to cook it...so I waited and then when my order came it was missing chicken..so the manager tells me that I am going to have to wait another 20 minutes for additional chicken.... so I asked for my money back and the assistant manager David Jackson was upset that I wanted my money back. Hey David this is my money and not yours...so thanks for it back. He stated that there was all new people working so that is the reason why the service is soooooo slow...This is the last time going to KFC on WESTERN AVE...Every single time I go there it is a wait for chicken or they mess up the order. I vowed to stay away but damn I love the fried chicken and the only spot close enough to me. Please CORPORATE get rid of this Franchise on WESTERN AVE because they are useless and hopefully we can get a Zaxbys....POPEYES...or something else to replace this hell hole. Now I got to order a Pizza because I do not want to drive for any other chicken. KFC you get the finger for poor service..poor attitude from manager and hiring all new employees to work on a Friday night.. FINGER LICKING NOT SO GOOD....F RATING,neg
65,Y,0,1,2,I've been coming here for over 2 years and I have not once had good service!!!! Acceptable @ times but NEVER GOOD! So much so my husband cringes everytime I say let's go there. Today I came in by myself @1:17. I was not so professionally told to sit there she cleaned it @ 1:21. They were very busy I understand that... I was near the register 2 waitress/ hostess 1 buser & 1 cook past me multiple times. It is now 1:34 not one person ever came to my table... The sad thing is they have good food. But They A) don't have enough people to run a busy restaurant and B) the people who are there don't give a diddly squat!!!!,neg
66,Y,0,10,2,Great food but it could be cleaner I saw a roach crawling on the wall out where I was eating. The roach was gross but I still go back. Just wish they would clean a bit more or have pest control come out.,pos
67,Y,44,7,4,"I have mixed feelings about this place, but I'll give the 4 stars simply based on the food alone. If you can get past the slow and rude service, the occasional unwelcomed vibe and the language barrier, be prepared for some delicious authentic Asian cuisine. The fish filet in Szechuan pepper sauce is life!",pos
68,Y,84,2,4,Service is not the greatest but the food will keep us coming back. Kung Po is fantastic.,neg
69,Y,0,7,4,Best Pho in town.,pos
70,Y,0,4,5,Wow great Chinese food. Service is nice and friendly. Food is fresh and hot. Quick and easy meal for takeout. I always get takeout fried rice and its delicious.,pos
71,Y,0,3,3,"Great food. Especially if you're on a college budget like me, I'd recommend trying the fajitas for two. It's easliy enough to feed 3 or 4 people and only about 18 bucks or so. Also have a cheese dip. You can get a large bowl for $5. At Cancun's it cost $5 for a regular sized cheese dip which is probably not even half its size. I never have had a cheese dip I didn't finish until eating at Soccer Taco because it's so huge! The down sides are the service is mediocre and the floors are always dirty when I eat there, which in their defense I usually don't get there until it's an hour or so until closing time. There is always straw papers, food remants, etc. in the booths and on the floor. The bathroom was trashed the one time I went in there. I won't go back in the bathroom unless I have to.",pos
72,Y,0,4,3,"Not bad. Decent prices. The service screws up orders here and there. Overall, nothing memorable.",pos
73,Y,0,1,4,"We just moved here from NY and just wanted an inexpensive meal. We really liked the feel of this place, and were surprised by the quality of the food. This is a good value, the staff is nice and cool, and the prices and food are good.",pos
74,Y,0,1,3,"Tea was super good, fries were ok they needed more seasoning. The burger was nothing like I expected. It was supposed to come on Texas toast, but it was definitely white bread... and burnt. I asked for extra pickles because they don't have jalapenos. However, the pickles were sweet so once again not what I expected and that was an additional .50 charge for a 1oz souffle cup. I told the owner the bread was soggy upon opening my togo order, but she didn't say anything. Just looked at me...go elsewhere for a burger. This is not the place.",pos
75,Y,3,25,5,Dreaming of Jackie's Dream! Overall great experience as always.,pos
76,Y,0,7,5,Great food selections and service. Quality food and experiences. Grateful for the owner and staff interactions. Great selections and prices. Bring your friends!,pos
77,Y,0,3,5,"Hot chicken, fried okra, and service are all tops. You won't be sorry.",pos
78,Y,322,1,1,"We were eager to visit Tupelo Honey on our recent trip to Knoxville, but were turned away. The restaurant had plenty of unreserved seating available for lunch, and the hostess, without hesitation, told us the wait would be 2 1/2 hours",pos
79,Y,16,85,1,Bland Unseasoned Food... don't go,neu
80,Y,0,24,3,It was good but expensive for the amount of food you got....slow getting our food too,pos
81,Y,0,3,3,"We visited this place a dozen times due to its location and supposed popularity. Each time we were slightly more disappointed than before. This place is fine to try just to see what all the hype is about, but not worth visiting more than a couple times.",neg
82,Y,0,2,3,THC is OK and they try to be different and succeed for the most part.,pos
83,Y,117,4,3,sweet. potatoes,pos
84,Y,11,7,3,"We were underwhelmed. It didn't live up to the hype, other than that the fried green tomatoes were delicious. It cam to the table, two slices, nicely breaded, with no sauce for spreading in the slices or dipping. I had to ask for a side sauce and the server looked at me like I was an alien. Service was good, but my food did not live up to the hype other than the tomatoes. Of course, I only had a burger, but it was bland and nothing special about the meat or the bun. Four friends seemed to enjoy their food but there was none of the 'Wow, you've got to try this"" factor present. Maybe they do better with their southern dishes like meatloaf. I wouldn't go back, simply for the fact that there are places to eat on Market Square that have better food for the price.",pos
85,Y,0,1,4,Ryan was an amazing server! Best I've had in a while. He was so knowledgeable and allowed time for us to browse the menu as it was our first visit. He was able to provide the best choices for my family and I. He did not disappoint. I hope all servers are as great as him!,pos
86,Y,5,1,1,"I've tried this out a few times and without exception I always get treated rudely by employees. I work in the service industry also so I know how frustrating it can be but there is no excuse to not respond when a customer tells you ""thank you""",neu
87,Y,115,1,1,By far the worst fast food in Knoxville. Nothing about it is fast and my food is never correct. I come back here every so often to give them another chance and it has not changed! Everyone here moves slow and has the worst attitude.,neg
88,Y,0,8,1,One star is giving them too much.. As a former employee I must say this location by far is the absolute worst. Manager Coco Started harassing my wife about spending too much time in the lobby area when I was on the clock. Which wasn't true because she was in the process of handing me money to pay for her food while she was on lunch break. She proceeded to harass and saying that she was impeding the flow of customers when she herself was a customer a paying customer might I add ! She followed us out into the parking lot yelling and cursing at my wife. I quit on the spot and definitely do not recommend this location to eat or to work. I am very disappointed at the amount of employees who are constantly on their phones while on the clock . And as a customer they are very quick to notice who it is and be very unprofessional gossip when I am walking away and generally ignoring me and my wife on purpose. Not to mention I get an entire dollar more at my current job that I do hear the pay is not worth the price you pay to work like a dog and be treated like crap !,neg
89,Y,0,10,2,It was pretty bad. The only thing that was good was the soft taco supreme. Somebody tried to steal money from a person in the drive thru while I was there. Taco pizza was okay.,pos
90,Y,31,2,1,"Cockroach in my chicken burrito. Yes. Sat down after a loong Christmas drive way my family to have a meal. Spent $57 for everyone to eat .....only to find that when I opened up my burrito there was a baby bug.... roach looking thing on it. Listen folks, do yourself a favor and don't stop here EVER. I asked the manager to comeOver and see it. Was told by the Ms. Manager that they don't ever have anything bug problems...... and she just looked at me. I said well we just spent $57 in food and I almost ate a cockroach!!!! I wanted our money back. Nobody wanted to continue to eat anything at this point. We could barely hold down the few bites everyone had taken. She wanted to refund me the $1.99 for the taco that I actually found the bug in?!?!?!.... ummmm no. Not good enough for me. I want my money back..... and that still doesn't help me feel better as far as I'm concerned. I came centimeters away from consuming a disease infested dead bug .... and my kids?!?!? Omg! What if it was theirs... and they didn't check to see if their lunch was full of bugs? Long story short- she told me to call 1-800 Taco Bell..... want a crappy mgt. refused to reimburse our lunch. But just $21. let's just say it's not even worth one star obviously. I will be contacting the health department to follow up on this disgusting place of business. Go ahead ... order up some crunchy cockroach chicken in the meantime.",neg
91,Y,0,2,1,This place is an insult to Mexican food and culture. My taco was wrapped in aluminum foil like a burrito and tasted like it was in a crock pot all day. I will never eat here again.,pos
92,Y,2,14,4,The food was fantastic but I'm only giving 4 stars because I've been 3-4 times now and this place is so popular with the college groups parking is insane most of the time you have to drive around 2-3 times before someone leaves and there is literally always a wait. Glad they are business and making a profit but I will usually pick somewhere else because they are too popular.,pos
93,Y,94,3,5,"Not an exaggeration when I say this restaurant has never failed to go beyond expectations .... I have only been twice but each time has literally blown my mind. Cannot emphasize enough how good this restaurant is ; amazing food, good service and and overall great atmosphere.",pos
94,Y,0,2,5,Their Carne Asada burrito is the best!,pos
95,Y,119,1,2,"The absolute worst margarita I have ever had. TARTNESS is off the charts. On a better note, I had the burrito flat iron and it was good. Throw down a. Wet here peeps.",pos
96,Y,59,3,3,Employees were quite rude. While we were waiting for a table the bartender was quite rude and then hostess was even more rude. She didn't care about us. Was looking forward to eating here this being my my first time in town and visiting. I was disappointed. Our server was good. She was nice and apologetic. Our server was the only reason I didn't give a 1 star review,neg
97,Y,81,15,4,Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.,pos
98,Y,0,1,1,"I would have given 4 stars for the food. Great old school egg rolls. The buffet and food ordered are always very good. But they are so RUDE! It's like they're pissed off at you for spending your money there. I refer to them as the ""Dragon Ladies"". It was funny at first. Kinda like the ""Soup Nazi"" from the Seinfeld tv show. But the last time I went they were total jerks. As much as I love their food, I probably won't be back. Others I've talked to feel the same way. They need an attitude adjustment to say the least. I was about to go off on them, but thought maybe the older dude cooking the food might be a Kung Fu master. And give me the Bruce Lee fiver finger death punch. Haha! Anyway the rudeness out ways the food. Avoid unless you like to be insulted.",neg
99,Y,0,2,5,"Best in town, food is always fresh and tastes great. You cannot beat the lunch buffet for $6 if you have time to wait.",pos
100,Y,0,5,1,I've never been sicker in my life! The oysters I ordered were barely warm and tasted just awful! Our waitress was no where to be found but showed up long enough to leave the check. She didn't ask if everything was alright (or I would have told her!) nor did she acknowledge my food was barely touched. It wasn't even an hour later before I was expelling what little I ate. I will NEVER return to this place.,neg
101,Y,0,8,1,"terrterrible,  terrible, terrible. if you want to imagine you live in a third world country, this is your place.",neg
102,Y,13,1,1,"I have been here a few times and recommended friends about this place until this happened. I think there was a miscommunication so I didn't get what I ordered, which was totally fine. They could have explained to me that there was only 1 cook and if the order was wrong they have to ""throw it away"". I would get that and take the food. The girl was so passively aggressive about it. I didn't think it was a big deal until she did that. I love your food but please train your staffs better. thank you.",pos
103,Y,0,2,1,This was my first time coming to this restaurant. So I asked about many different dishes. I asked about the Beef Laab. And she said she DID recommend it. That it was GOOD and fishy. When we got our food it tasted like a mint planet. That's all that I could taste was the mint. It was not good. So I asked another server which was super nice and friendly if I could change my meal. And the other server from before got mad and yelled across the restaurant towards us that she didn't recommend it to us and told us that it was not good. Which was a lie. The nice server told us sorry about that and gave us a refund for the meal and told us that the other girl is always snippy and rude like that. Our server was extremely rude and snippy. If you are going to be rude and you are working for that job you shouldn't be there working.,pos
104,Y,0,15,3,It's okay... average. Not my favorite!,neg
105,Y,0,23,3,"Forgot part of our order, but still pretty good food.  I've gotten take out several times.",pos

107,Y,0,7,4,"Very expensive for what it was. The staff and quality is great, it just is very expensive",pos
108,Y,1,8,4,"This has to be one of the best kept secrets in Knoxville. Their pho is amazing as is just about everything on the menu. Ask for the crispy chicken skins (they aren't on the menu). If they have them, they are incrdeible. Thie noodle bowls are great. The food is 5 star, but I took a star off because the interior, while clean as a whistle, is a bit spartan.",pos
109,Y,0,15,4,One of my favorite restaurants anywhere. There food is great and they are always so nice.,pos
110,Y,0,9,4,"I've only been here once. I got the Phoritto, it was pretty good! Better than I expected. Will definitely return and try some other items.",pos
111,Y,0,3,1,"I use to go often, but no more. The food is good and never had any problem with the service, but if you are a concealed carry permit holder, and exercising your right to carry, eat out and protect you and your family at the same time, this is not the place. They don't post on the entrance, but you will see a sign on the wall behind the cash register quoting a law that has been changed by the State of Tennessee. It still indicates to me that The manager or owner does not want me to eat there.",pos
112,Y,0,2,1,Had a horrible experience and the manager with the shaved head did not seem to care. Will go to Wok Hay or Genghis Grill next time.,neg
113,Y,0,6,3,"been there a couple of times and is good  ,,,but,,,,,, the only thing i didnt like is i got the same thing every time ))) the sesame chicken and
the portions were different each time first time was  alot and ate it all  and this last time is was very very spicy ,, think they added something but whatever it was it was too much heat    i couldnt eat it all  too spicy !!!
try something different next time",neg
114,Y,0,4,3,"I love the Pad Thai! Mu husband ordered a Thai dish with steak and chicken with brown rice and his meal was cold.. poor thing just had to eat it for not complaining. I insisted he went to tell the cook , but he was very hungry and just ate his cold food. Other than that we have had great experiences prior to today.",pos
115,Y,10,18,3,"Good food, sticky messy floors and messy beverage service area.",neg
116,Y,5,1,4,This is a great place for some quick Chinese food.  I have eaten here many times and as always their service is prompt and the food is consistently delicious.,pos
117,Y,0,4,4,I love PF Chang's but don't always have the time or money to make it a regular thing.  Pei Wei gives me the same full belly in a more convenient location.  It's usually the only place in Turkey Creek I eat.  Highly recommend.,pos
118,Y,0,19,4,"This is a great little restaurant with really good food...I loved this place...only one problem...the food is ""LOADED"" with garlic...not that I don't like garlic but I mean it is really loaded with it and the smell lasts for days and days after you eat there!!  But I will go back...when I know I am going to be able to stay away from every one for a few days!!!",pos

121,Y,0,6,5,I love the Kung Pao chicken.,pos
122,Y,0,2,5,The food is great and the staff recognizes us and gives us great service. We try and get there at least once a week for lunch. Better menu than P F Chang,pos
123,Y,0,1,1,Terrible customer service!  We got the wrong change back and called back after we got home from picking up our order and all the manager had to say was it had been too long to be able to tell if the change was wrong!  What ever happened to the customer is always right.  I will never go back to this place again!,neg
124,Y,0,2,2,I had a  take out order. Eggroll was old and tasteless. The wonton soup was poor at best. watered down broth and wontons fell apart from sitting to long in broth. I wont go back.,pos
125,Y,0,4,3,"3.5 stars. Authentic Chinese food , but it's not authentic szechuan style Chinese food",neu
126,Y,0,5,4,"The waitress was attentive and kept my glass filled. The meal is served in three rounds, soup first then egg roll, and the the entree. I don't really recommend the general tso's chicken as an entree, but the rice and steamed broccoli was more than enough food after the soup and egg roll. I will definitely be dining in again.",pos
127,Y,0,3,5,Been coming here for years. Now we just call it in and pick it up from the drive thru option. Always made correct always very good and you can't beat the cost!,pos

151,Y,1,2,1,"the service was so bad. the waiter take the order in hurry and not patient at all. We ask for recommendation for the ordering the dishes, but they don't even say any. We ask for4 different sever to get the fork and ice water. The seafood soup are just water with a few piece of seafood. Twice cooked pork was only cabbage. The chicken wings are OK but not that excellent for us. We though that they already charge for the tip on the bill. One of the sever run for to get the tip and he didn't even explain anything about bill. The black bean source noodle is better in Korean restaurant at Geary Street.  Since the service and the food wasn't good enough, we will never go back. If you don't care about the service and just to try the food, you may want to go one time. For us the food wasn't as good as we heard.",neg
152,Y,0,2,1,"Burma Superstar is one of the most overrated restaurants in a place ( San Francisco ) with a lot of overrated restaurants. I've been going here for many years but I've noticed over the past few years the protein portions have gotten a lot smaller and the service slower and less friendly. Last but not least, rats can be seen inside the restaurant on Clement St . when walking by late at night. I'm sorry to say this but it's absolutely disgusting. I've had enough and I won't be returning.",neg

160,Y,0,3,2,"We used to like Burma Superstar very much, go there on special occasions and recommend for friends.
We know that the place is small and usually the waiting is outside

today, we had friends from France visiting and decided to visit Burma Superstar again

We got there at 3:20 in order not to have to wait to much ( they get orders unitl 3:30)

it was a cold and reining day

getting there, a very waitress immediately asked us to clean the door and to chosse our food outside. I was with my 7 months baby and asked her if I could wait in a corner inside

she was adamant saying no. No for waiting on a corner ( only me, not my party), no for having the stroller, no for everything

what is the point of  going to a place and being treated worse than cattle

finally, we noticed that they are serving smaller portions ( same price)

now, we have to find another special place

fame spoiled Burma Superstar",pos

176,Y,0,3,4,We went on a weekday night so luckily wasn't too bad. We put our names on the Yelp Waitlist before Rainbow Salad. It has 22 different ingredients with four coconut Rice. The meat was seasoned perfectly and really really tender. It's worth it to order the coconut rice white/brown rice. It's delicious with their curry!,pos

I eat there at least once a week and now my daughter is obsessed with Burma too, her favorite dish is sesame chicken. I order take out more than eat at the restaurant, it can get loud in there at peak hours.",pos

202,Y,0,3,1,"this is the lousest service i recieved from a restaurant!!!
maybe because they enjoy a very good business, all the waiters/waitresses just do not care about the customers. no smile, no greetings, ignore you even when they see you waving at them. its just humiliating to be sitting there wait for their attention. i don't care about their food (which they are not the best around, there are more better one in central sunset or richmond) and their price (which is actually pricy in term of their menu), i just cannot tolerate waiting in line for an hour, and dine in a crowded and noisy and dirty place, and finally have to look at the awful faces and attitudes of the waiters (even the owner).

as a customer who demands respect, i will not recommend this restaurant at all.",neg
